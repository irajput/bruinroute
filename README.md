# BruinRoute
A repository containing all our work for Digital Humanities 110 final project.

Since screen recordings are too large to upload, please see the recordings folder in our drive: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1q3QAyz1ZITNF0VBRVr7DW3ScyIkh8TBW?usp=sharing

Final Presentation added to the Google Drive, and the link is available in the github too.

Note: This link is only shared with people with a UCLA email since this repository is public. Also ALL materials are available at this link.
